 # Diary-System
 # Why This Project Was Made
 
Storing diary information on your computer can be unintuitive for several reasons including the hassle to create new files, trying to find which diary was which, etc.

This is why the diary management system comes in. It solves a lot of problems about storing your diaries. You no longer have to worry about protection or scrolling through a lot of files to find the diary number you want to access.

The diary management system is the perfect tool for people that don’t want to use the usual Windows UI, and want something more complex for storing their diaries.
